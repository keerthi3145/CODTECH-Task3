### Project Overview: CreativeThoughts - What's your today?

**CreativeThoughts** is an engaging web platform designed to empower users to express themselves creatively through writing. With a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation, this project allows individuals to share their thoughts, ideas, and stories in the form of blog posts. Below is an overview of the key features and functionality of the platform:

#### 1. **Navigation Bar**

   - **Navigation Links**: Provides easy access to key sections of the website, including a home link to return to the main page.
   - **Writing Button**: A prominent call-to-action button encourages users to start writing their posts.
   - **Theme Toggle**: Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes, improving accessibility and user comfort.
